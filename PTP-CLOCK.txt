SYNC TEST
*** To test on localhost, on both laptop or raspi:
go into folder-> 

$cd Documents/Radja/clockkit/
$cd ClockKit && make test

----
SYNCHRO BETWEEN RASPI AND LAPTOP.

*** first command, always do this unless environment was added into .bashrc :
$export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)

*** To sync host B to host A: (HOST A will be lab laptop : original IP adress on the LAN network -> 169.254.235.59* - To simplify, we can run using 0.0.0.0 to run on all interfaces)
chose random port (a random number, really) bigger than 1024 and smaller than 49152. check availability of port before with :

$sudo netstat -tuln | grep <port number>

-> if it shows nothing it is free and you can proceed.
/!\ Attention, The Windows firewall needs to be off or allowing port communication on that specific port.

*** On host A (should be laptop), when you are in folder ClockKit :
$ckserver <IP address to bind to> <port>

An example (TO USE unless you are sure of what you are doing):
ckserver 0.0.0.0 4567

/!\ Packet forwarding configurations are done for port 4567. Please use this port value.


On host B (raspberry.):

***(((( ONLY DO THIS If you are restarting the sync and know what you are doing. Otherwise, configuration was done )))) ///
cp clockkit.conf my-clockkit.conf
Edit my-clockkit.conf. Set the server to host A, e.g., 192.168.1.1 or myhost.example.com. Set the port to 4567, or whatever port you told ckserver to use.
\\\

***Start :
$./ckphaselock my-clockkit.conf

if an ssh connection is suggested, it should be automatically configurated to BioTFT-admin@169.254.235.59. However, if it isn't, please modify the ssh configuration file again on the raspberry.
